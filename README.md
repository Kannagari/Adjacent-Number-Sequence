# Adjacent-Number-Sequence
This program generates a 2D array of unique, random integers between 0 - 24, and finds the longest sequence of adjacent integers. Adjacent in this case is defined as any number that is +/- 1 of the current number, and is either above, below, left, or right of the current number. Diagonals do not count as adjacent in this case.
